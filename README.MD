# DataC102 Final Project 
Sushant Vema, Spring 2023

## Objective
This repo contains my EDA for the project checkpoint. Current initiatives:
1. Timeseries analysis of asthma mortalities over time in a certain state, with a certain stratification, and using either un-normalized/crude/age-adjusted metrics.

## Running my code
Use the terminal or an Anaconda Prompt for the following steps:
1. Create the environment from the `102_project_env.yml` file
```bash
conda env create -f 102_project_env.yml
```
2. Activate the environment: `conda activate 102_final_project
3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
```bash
conda env list
```
